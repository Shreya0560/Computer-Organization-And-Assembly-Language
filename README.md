# Computer-Organization-And-Assembly-Language 
This repository contains the two projects done in my Computer Organization and Assembly Language (0447) course. 

Project 1-
In this project, I used MIPS assembly language to create a game titled "Meteor Storm". In this game, there is a spaceship that can move in all 4 directions, and the objective of the game is to successfully shoot 10 meteors before all 3 lives are lost. A life is lost when a meteor hits the spaceship. The main code is in the file titled sha94_proj1.asm

Project 2-In this project, I used logism to create a functioning single cycle CPU
